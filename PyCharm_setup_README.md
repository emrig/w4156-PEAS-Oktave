#Setting Path variable to recognize lib

In PyCharm, you have to set the path to individual folders within your local project:

Assuming you have already created a virtual environment per the main readme and cloned the latest code locally, 

1. Go to File > Settings > Project w4156-PEASE-Oktave > Project Interpreter
2. Click the drop-down menu at the top and select 'Show All..."
3. Click the bottom button on the right which is an icon of a, directory structure and add these folders to the list (your local paths will differe from mine)
  
  * C:\Github\w4156-PEASE-Oktave\
  * C:\Github\w4156-PEASE-Oktave\code\
  * C:\Github\w4156-PEASE-Oktave\tests\
  * C:\Github\w4156-PEASE-Oktave\lib\
